This code is  about OSPF protocol :
    That is sending the routing information to all the routers

How i have implemented the code?
    For every router in have created four threds
    1 for sending the hello packets, hello reply packets
    2 for recieving the hello reply packets
    3 for sending the LSA packets
    4 for creating the routing Table

    i have created the threads because all shoudl run paralley that's why 
    4 threads are used for each router

after some time lets say 42 secods i am sleeping sice to wait for the 
updating of the routing Table ( 2 times ) and then exit out of the programme

COMMENT:
    This is very useful assignment 
    
    from this assignment i have learned that how the networks works and how the packets
    are transformed in the networks
    
    Based on every situation the router builds its correspoing routing table and sends the
    packet to the Destination
